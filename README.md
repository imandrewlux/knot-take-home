# Take-Home Assignment for Knot

This project was built with **React**, using **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development and styling. It simulates a transaction dashboard and explores the kind of interactivity and structure you might see in a financial or order management interface.

### âœ¨ Features
- The **sidebar** opens/closes and includes fully functional **filters** for:
  - Order **status**
  - Type of **credit card** used
  - **Product name**  
- The **navigation buttons** are non-functional placeholders meant to show how the interface might scale into a multi-view layout.
- I added a **subtle, mouse-responsive gradient background** to introduce a light touch of interactivity and polish without distracting from the core experience.
- The layout and structure were designed with extensibility in mindâ€”thereâ€™s room to add more filters or data groupings (e.g., filter by tax, eligibility, or order total).

### ðŸ§ª Data
The dummy order data is loosely based on Knotâ€™s [TransactionLink object](https://docs.knotapi.com/api-reference/products/transaction-link/transaction-object) and was extended using AI-assisted generation to simulate a more realistic, varied dataset.
